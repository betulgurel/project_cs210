# CS210 Project - Semester Performance Analysis

This Jupyter Notebook (`CS210_PROJECT_BETULGUREL_22509.ipynb`) is part of a project that aims to analyze the academic performance of the author (Betul Gurel) over four semesters at Sabanci University. The primary focus is on understanding the seasonal effects on student grades using personal observations and grades.

## Overview

The project uses Python with libraries such as pandas, numpy, and scipy for data manipulation, analysis, and statistical testing. The main steps of the analysis include:

1. Loading the dataset from the Excel file (`DATASET.xlsx`) containing the author's course grades and observations.

2. Mapping letter grades to numerical values for better analysis.

3. Separating the dataset into four semesters: Fall 2021-22, Spring 2021-22, Fall 2022-23, and Spring 2022-23.

4. Calculating the average grades for each semester.

5. Performing t-tests to compare the averages between Fall 2021-22 and Fall 2022-23, as well as between Spring 2021-22 and Spring 2022-23.

6. Checking the statistical significance of the differences in averages.

7. Calculating the overall average grades for the fall and spring semesters.

## Files

- `CS210_PROJECT_BETULGUREL_22509.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data analysis.

- `DATASET.xlsx`: The Excel file containing the dataset used in the analysis.

## Usage

To run the analysis, make sure you have the necessary Python libraries installed (`pandas`, `numpy`, `scipy`). Additionally, ensure that the dataset file (`DATASET.xlsx`) is in the same directory as the notebook.

Execute the cells in the notebook sequentially, and the results will be displayed, including semester averages, t-test results, and conclusions about the seasonal effects on grades.

## Results
In the results section, period averages, t-test results and comments on the statistical significance of the differences in the averages are included. Based on these results, students' terms academic improvements and development in academic life solutions are included in the report.

## Limitations and Future Work
The analysis is limited by the dataset's reliance on personal observations and grades. In the future, using a more diverse dataset representing a broader student population would enhance the generalizability of the findings. Additionally, incorporating other factors that may influence student performance would contribute to a more comprehensive analysis.
